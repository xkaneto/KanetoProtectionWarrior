This rotation has special conditions for the following Shadowlands Legendaries: The Wall, Thunderlord, Reprisal.

Thunderlord will use more Thunder Claps in AOE groups.
The Wall will use more Shield Slam.

If you use Reprisal as Legendary, please make sure to activate AutoCharge and InterveneOn for fully automatic Shield Block uptime.
You will then spin around like a Beyblade.
